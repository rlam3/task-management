# Task Management Application

A full-stack task management application built with FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and Vue.js.

## Development Approach

We're following a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach:

1. Write failing tests
2. Write minimal code to pass tests
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

## Task List
